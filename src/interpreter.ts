/**
 * graphql-js interpreter for the breadth-first executor. Runs conventional
 * `GraphQLFieldResolver<TSource, TContext>` functions inside the breadth model.
 *
 *   - `InterpretedFieldResolver` wraps a graphql-js resolver and invokes it
 *     per-object. Sync resolvers complete inline; any Promise returns are
 *     batched into `InterpretedPromiseLoader`, which awaits them all together as
 *     a single breadth-loader cycle. The field's final result is a fully
 *     resolved array — no Promises leak past the loader.
 *   - `interpretSchema(schema)` walks a `GraphQLSchema` and emits a
 *     `ResolverMap` whose entries delegate to each field's `resolve`
 *     (or `ObjectKeyResolver(fieldName)` when the field has no resolver).
 *   - Abstract types get a `__type__` entry that adapts
 *     `abstractType.resolveType` or falls back to walking
 *     `isTypeOf` on each possible type.
 *
 * Restrictions, surfaced as errors:
 *   - `info.path` — breadth-first execution resolves all objects at a level
 *     together, so there is no per-object resolution path. Accessing
 *     `info.path` throws an `ImplementationError`. All other
 *     `GraphQLResolveInfo` fields are populated for field resolvers.
 *   - Abstract type resolvers (`resolveType` / `isTypeOf`) still receive a
 *     stub `info` that throws on any access — the planner invokes them
 *     without an `ExecutionField` in scope.
 *   - Async `resolveType` / `isTypeOf` — abstract type discrimination must
 *     be synchronous. Returning a `Promise` throws an `ImplementationError`.
